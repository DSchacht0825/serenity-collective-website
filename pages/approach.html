            <p>A practical, Christ-centered approach to walking together through the 12 steps in community. Jesus-centered addiction recovery open to all.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="about-content serenity-page-fullwidth">
            <div class="about-text">
                <p>The Serenity Collective is working together to design, pilot, and train people in a practical, Christ-centered approach to walking together through the 12 steps. Our ministry serves communities with Jesus-centered recovery groups. Serenity groups meet for 13 sessions. The first session is open to anyone who is considering being part of our faith-based recovery community. In the next 12 sessions, we support each other to work through each of the 12 steps. Each session includes group teaching, small group exercises, discussion, and homework tasks to work the step, build supportive connections, and develop new life habits.</p>

                <h3>Key Characteristics of Serenity Groups</h3>

                <h4>Jesus-Centered</h4>
                <p>Many people aren't aware that the 12 steps are rooted in the life of Jesus and the teachings of the New Testament. To make the 12 steps widely accessible, God language shifted to "higher power" and many of the explicit connections to scripture were removed. For many of us, a self-defined concept of "higher power" got us going on our healing journey, but we've found greater potency in having a clearer understanding of God as revealed in Jesus. In Serenity Groups, we help each other appreciate how the 12 steps are basic building blocks of discipleship and invite each other to explore how an interactive relationship with God can bring healing and satisfy the deepest needs of our souls.</p>

                <h4>Inclusive</h4>
                <p>We think that the 12 steps contain basic elements of discipleship to Jesus that are relevant to anyone who wants to explore what it means to follow him. It can be stigmatizing to group people together according to their specific addictive tendencies, as if the rest of us don't have struggles of our own. We all have unhelpful ways we've learned to live apart from conscious contact with God. In Serenity Groups, we don't group people according to specific addictive tendencies, recognizing that we all have challenges to overcome and care to give one another.</p>

                <h4>Relational</h4>
                <p>Change is a process that requires taking tangible new steps. We are more likely to make positive changes in the context of grace-filled and supportive relationships. In Serenity Groups, we aim to create deepening relationships of safety, authenticity, deep care, and trust. Leaders fully participate and also function as mentors who express empathy and care and support others to have success in working the steps.</p>

                <h4>Positive Identity-Focused</h4>
                <p>Many recovery programs label people according to the substance or behavior that they find difficult to manage. We think it's more effective to help each other recognize our truest identities as God's beloved children who are loved, forgiven, and empowered to be peaceful, joyful, and free. Our goal isn't just to stop certain behaviors; it is to experience the wholeness, grace, and connection with God that were missing, which led us to seek comfort and satisfaction in ways that are ultimately unsatisfying.</p>

                <h4>Action-Oriented</h4>
                <p>In a lot of recovery processes, group meetings and working the steps with a sponsor are separate activities. In Serenity Groups, leaders and participants work the steps together over 12 weeks. This requires a higher initial commitment, but we think the group support and accountability create a powerful dynamic for growth and recovery. Each person is challenged and invited to work the step at their level of ability and understanding. At the beginning of each meeting, we meet in groups of 3-4 to check in on what we've done to work the step since we last met.</p>
